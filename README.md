## Repository Description
This repository contains my solution for **Lab Assignment 1: Ashesi Premier League – Football Player Management System**.  

The lab introduces fundamental Java programming concepts, including:
- Variables and data types
- Type casting
- Increment and decrement operators
- Boolean expressions and logical operators
- Selection statements (if, else-if, nested ifs)
- Switch cases (with break and fall-through)
- Conditional (ternary) operator

## Final Deliverable
The final integrated program (`PlayerSelection.java`) includes:
- Accepting player details from keyboard input  
- Converting data types (height to cm, weight to kg)  
- Categorizing players (Rising Star, Prime Player, Veteran)  
- Assigning positions based on jersey numbers  
- Checking eligibility with logical conditions  
- Selecting lineup with nested if statements  
- Final decision using the ternary operator  
- Demonstrating switch fall-through behavior
